Flutter Project Structure
Flutter is an open source technology used for building native apps for mobile, web, and desktop platforms. Flutter encourages developers to follow the best practices in project structure organization to facilitate code maintenance and collaboration throughout the development life cycle.
Here are the fundamental components of a Flutter project structure implemented in the project
lib
The lib directory of a Flutter project contains application specific code, which includes multiple directories or packages. This directory usually contains most of the application’s logic and deals with the core functionality of the app. Developers can add or remove directories and packages as per the project requirements. The idea is to have a structured and organized architecture to make code management easy. After creating the project  I added the following folders, sub-folders and files in the project. 
assets/images - mkdir -p assets/images
--The assets folder holds subfolders such as images, fonts, and configuration files.
lib/pages : mkdir -p lib/pages
– The pages folder holds user interface (UI) files such as logins, lists of items, charts,
and settings.
lib/models : mkdir -p lib/models
– The models folder holds classes for your data such as customer information and
inventory items.
lib/utils :  mkdir -p lib/utils
– The utils folder holds helper classes such as date calculations and data conversion.
lib/widgets :  mkdir -p lib/widgets
--The widgets folder holds different Dart files separating widgets to reuse
through the app.
lib/services : The services folder holds classes that help to retrieve data from services over the
Internet. A great example is when using Google Cloud Firestore, Cloud Storage, Realtime Data-
base, Authentication, or Cloud Functions. You can retrieve data from social media accounts, data-
base servers, and so on. In Chapters 14, 15, and 16, you will learn how to use state management to
authenticate users, retrieve and sync database records from the cloud by using Cloud Firestore.
home.dart file inside the pages folder - touch lib/pages/home.dart
ui folder - mkdir -p lib/ui
models.dart file inside models folder - touch lib/models/models.dart
utils.dart file inside util folder 
assets 
The assets directory contains images, fonts, videos, and other static resources used in the app. For instance, if you have app images or videos, you should add them to the assets directory.
test
The test directory contains all the test files that the developer will write to check either of the code, widget behavior, or APIs. Running test cases is an essential aspect of app development. Flutter encourages writing tests alongside the production code to catch bugs during development.
ios and android
The ios and android directories contain the configuration files, app icon, splash screen, and other related code for iOS and Android platforms. Flutter compiles the code using its native ARM library, so it generates an easy-to-compile SDK for Android and iOS platforms.
lib/main.dart
The lib/main.dart file is the entry point to the application, and it must contain the main function and define an app widget. The app widget assigns the home variable to launch the UI of the app.
pubspec.yaml
pubspec.yaml is the project configuration file used to manage the application's dependencies and metadata. This file includes information like the app’s name, version, description, and other package dependencies. It is also used to contain metadata for publishing the app on the platform-specific app store.
Conclusion
Following a well-defined and organized project structure makes the process of code maintenance, collaboration, and testing seamless. This helps developers focus on building the application’s functionality instead of worrying about the construction of their code structure. I have therefore sworn that I will follow proper well defined structure to make my projects organized and easier to manage and DEBUG
